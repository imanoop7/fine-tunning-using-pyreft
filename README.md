## Overview

Fine-tuning models is a critical step in optimizing their performance for specific tasks. This repository demonstrates how to fine-tune models using the Pyreft library, which provides a flexible and efficient framework for this process.

## Requirements

To run the fine-tuning process, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pyreft(https://github.com/stanfordnlp/pyreft)
- PyTorch
- Transformers (Hugging Face)
- Datasets (Hugging Face)
- CUDA (for GPU support)

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imanoop7/fine-tunning-using-reft.git
cd fine-tunning-using-pyreft
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Open the Jupyter notebook and follow the steps to fine-tune your model:

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. Open `fine_tuning_using_pyreft.ipynb` in your browser.

3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to load the dataset, configure the model, and initiate the fine-tuning process.
